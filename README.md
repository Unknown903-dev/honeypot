# honeypot subdomain website

I created this to prevent bots from making request to random paths on a subdomain websites that didnt exist this is meant for websites hosted through cloudfared it logs ip's and extra info its main functions slows down request if you enter a suspicous path 
and if you make to many request it bans the ip from your subdomain.
